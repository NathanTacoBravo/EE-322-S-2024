# Lab 8 â€” Data Analysis
Once I collected data from the rpidata python code from lab 7, I downloaded the google sheets file as a .cvs and edited the code provided to us to generate different graphs of the data I recorded.

- Note: I was unable to install tensorflow because of the io file system not being compatible with my Raspberry Pi Model and not enough RAM to run tensorflow.
