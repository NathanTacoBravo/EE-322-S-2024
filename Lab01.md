# Lab 1 - GHDL and GTKWave

For this lab I followed the step by step guide on how to get started with VHDL on my Windows machine by "Nerdy Dave" which was provided to us through the dsd file from our instructor's GitHub repository ([Kevin Lu](https://github.com/kevinwlu/dsd/tree/master/ghdl)). After installing GHDL & GTKWave and cloning the dsd repository, I ran the Half Adder and the D Flip-flop examples by using the comand promts found in the dsd repository. I recorded the results by taking screenshots of what each example looks like when running.
